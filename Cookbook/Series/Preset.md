# Manage series easier with a template

With [template](/Plugins/template) *(formerly known as preset)* plugin you can avoid having to duplicate configuration in multiple tasks. This can be adapted for movies, comics etc. easily. See [template](/Plugins/template) documentation for more tips.

  tv:
    download: ~/torrents/series/
