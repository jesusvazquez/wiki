# Set download path

When using a bittorrent client plugin as your output plugin, ([deluge](/Plugins/deluge) or [transmission](/Plugins/transmission),) you can [set](/Plugins/set) the `path` field of an entry to control where the client will save the content (the set plugin is also available as a per series option). This, combined with [jinja formatting](/Plugins/set#DynamicFormatting) allows all series to be easily downloaded to separate series and season folders. This recipe uses the transmission plugin, but that can easily be replaced with the deluge plugin.
