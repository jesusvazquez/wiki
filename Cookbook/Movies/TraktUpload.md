# Upload movie/tv collection to trakt.tv

These feeds will upload your collection to [trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv).

Upload movie collection to [trakt.tv](http://trakt.tv).
This is likely to generate errors and not work 100%. This is because of issues with other plugins. Most of my issues came from a unicode module not handling high order characters and the imdb plugin not matching all titles.

I would recommend making this a separate configuration file which you manually run only once or when needed. You can set up tract_acquired updating to your normal configuration file. If you put these into your config that is ran by cron, specify [interval](/Plugins/interval) for update feeds. Something along once per day or week.
