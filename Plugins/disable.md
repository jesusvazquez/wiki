# Disable

This plugin can be used to disable a plugin which you have included via the [template](/Plugins/template) or [include](/Plugins/include) plugin, as well as to disable [builtin](/Builtin) plugins.

### Configuration

This plugin should be configured with either the name of the plugin you wish to disable, or a list of plugins you wish to disable. You can also use the special term `builtins` to disable all builtin plugins.

### Example (disabling plugins from a template)

```
movies:
  download: ~/torrents/movies/
  imdb:
    min_score: 6.2
    .
    .

tasks:
  nzbs:
    template: movies
    disable: download
    sabnzbd:
      .
      .
```

Task nzbs uses all other configuration from template movies but removes the download plugin and instead uses [sabnzbd](/Plugins/sabnzbd).

### Example (disabling builtin plugins)

Disables all builtins:

```
disable: builtins
```

Disables the [seen](/Plugins/seen) and [seen_info_hash](/Plugins/seen_info_hash) builtins:

```
disable:
  - seen
  - seen_info_hash
```
