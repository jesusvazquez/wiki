# Letterboxd

This plugin produces an [entry](/Entry) for each film in any public [Letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com) list. These entries can then be added to the [movie_queue](/movie_queue#AddingRemovingusingTasks), used to initiate a search with [discover](/discover), or passed to some other [output plugin](/Plugins#Outputs). Results are cached for two hours to avoid flooding the site.
 
## Configuration


| =**Paramaters**    = | == | =An asterisk (*) indicates that the parameter is required = |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **username***        |    | Your or another user's Letterboxd username.  |
| **list***            |    | The name of a custom list, or one of the following built in lists: `watchlist`, `diary`, `likes`, `rated` or `watched`.  |
| **sort_by**          |    | Determines the order in which films in the list will be returned (see below).  |
| **max_results**      |    | An integer specifying the maximum number of films that will be returned from the list.  |
|                      |    |  |
|  |  | =**sort_by options** = |
| name                 |    | Sorted by film title, ascending alphabetically.  |
| added                |    | Sorted by the date the film was added to the list, from most to least recent.  |
| popularity           |    | Sorted in descending order of popularity among Letterboxd users.  |
| length-ascending     |    | Sorted by runtime, from shortest to longest.  |
| length-descending    |    | Sorted by runtime, from longest to shortest.  |
| rating-ascending     |    | Sorted by the average rating given by Letterboxd users, from lowest to highest.  |
| rating-descending    |    | Sorted by the average rating given by Letterboxd users, from highest to lowest.  |
| release-ascending    |    | Sorted by date of theatrical release, from least to most recent.  |
| release-descending   |    | Sorted by date of theatrical release, from most to least recent.  |

The **username** and **list** parameters should be entered exactly as they appear in the URL for the list. For example, to get films from a list at
  `http://letterboxd.com/some-user/list/some-users-list/`
the username would be `some-user` (not `Some User`), and the list would `some-users-list` (not `Some User's list`).

## Usage notes

The plugin can easily be used to queue up films from your Letterboxd watchlist to be downloaded by another task:

```
tasks:
  queue-letterboxd-watchlist:
    letterboxd:
      username: *****
      list: watchlist
    accept_all: yes
    movie_queue: add
```

In addition to `title`, `url`, `imdb_id`, `tmdb_id`, `movie_name` and `movie_year`, [entries](/Entry) created by the plugin are populated with a few site-specific fields:


|  |  | =**Entry fields** = |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **letterboxd_list**    |   | The list that the entry was pulled from, in the format `list (username)`.  |
| **letterboxd_score**   |   | The average rating (out of 10) given to the film by Letterboxd users (included when available).  |
| **letterboxd_uscore**  |   | The rating (out of 10) given to the film by the list owner (included for `diary` and `rated` lists).  |

You can of course [filter](/Plugins#Filters) against any of these fields. `letterboxd_list` may be useful where more than one input plugin (or [more than one Letterboxd list](/inputs)) is included in the task. `letterboxd_score` and `letterboxd_uscore` can used in conjunction with [Python if statements](/if), like so:

```
tasks:
  queue-well-reviewed-films:
    letterboxd:
      username: *****
      list: diary
    if:
      - 'letterboxd_uscore >= 8': accept
    movie_queue: add
```

When dealing with large lists, it may be worthwhile to feed entries to an intermediary plugin such as [trakt_add](/trakt_add). There is [no publicly available API for Letterboxd](http://letterboxd.com/api-coming-soon/) as of yet, so the plugin works by combing through the HTML source code for each film's page on the site. This isn't particularly fast if you want to, say, use [crossmatch](/crossmatch) to reject films you've marked as seen on Letterboxd. In that case, you could have your config set up like this:

```
tasks:
  add-to-trakt:
    letterboxd:
      username: *****
      list: watched
      sort_by: added
      max_results: 20  # <--- Set depending on how often you run the task; high enough that it will catch all new entries,
    accept_all: yes    #      but low enough so as not to parse (much) more of the list than is necessary. 
    trakt_add:
      username: *****
      password: *****
      list: watched

  download-films:
    some_input_plugin:
    ...
    crossmatch:
      from:
        - trakt_list:
            username: *****
            password: *****
            list: watched
            type: movies
      fields:
        - imdb_id
      action: reject
      ...
```
